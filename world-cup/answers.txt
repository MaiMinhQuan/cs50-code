Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I think that when we increase the number of simulations, the results will be more accurate.
Because when i try to simulate 10 times, the winner is USA, 100 times, the winner is England, 1000 times or more the winner is always Germany.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It is likely that the results stay the same after 10000 times of simulations.
